# Python is Case sensitive
# Space matters in Python
# ** for power of operation
# ^ for bitwise Xor operation
# // for dividing and round down to nearest integer
# Python allows multiple variable assignment in single line using single = operator
# String is an Immutable ordered sequence of characters
# Important useful functions:
# len -> get the length of a variable eg: len(a)
# type -> to check the data type of a variable. eg: type(a)
# print -> to print the information or outcome to the terminal eg: print("hello world")

# Important string functions:
title() -> eg: "jon andres".title() -> "Jon Andres"
is_lower() -> eg: "class".is_lower() -> True
lower() -> eg: "Class Mates".lower() -> "class mates"
count(word) -> eg: "Blue fish green fish red fish".count("fish") -> 3
split() -> eg: "Let's all dance".split() -> ["Let's", "all", "dance"] , "Let's all dance".split('.') -> ["Let's all dance", ""], "Let's all dance".maxsplit(None, 2) -> ["Let's", all dance"]

# List is a mutable ordered sequence of elements

# Important List functions:
len(list)
max(list)
min(list)
sum(list)
sorted(list)
join(list)
append(value)
pop()

# Tuples is an immutable ordered sequence of elements

# Set is a mutable unordered collection of unique elements
# Important Set functions:
add(value)
pop()
union(another_set)
intersection(another_set)
difference(another_set)

# Dictionary is a mutable object that stores mapping of unique keys to values
get(key)
is vs ==
